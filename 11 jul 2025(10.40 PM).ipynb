      "In the present education system of our country, specialised or discipline-\n",
      "based courses are introduced at the higher secondary stage. This stage \n",
      "is crucial as well as challenging because of the transition from general \n",
      "to discipline-based curriculum. The syllabus at this stage needs to have \n",
      "sufficient rigour and depth while remaining mindful of the comprehension \n",
      "level of the learners. Further, the textbook should not be heavily loaded \n",
      "with content.\n",
      "Computers have permeated in every facet of life. Study of basic concepts \n",
      "of computer science has been desirable in education. There are courses \n",
      "offered in the name of Computer Science, Information and Communication \n",
      "Technology (ICT), Information Technology (IT), etc., by various boards and \n",
      "schools up to secondary stage, as optional. These mainly focus on using \n",
      "computer for word processing, presentation tools and application software.\n",
      "Computer Science (CS) at the higher secondary stage of school education \n",
      "is also offered as an optional subject. At this stage, students usually opt \n",
      "for CS with an aim of pursuing a career in software development or related \n",
      "areas, after going through professional courses at higher levels. Therefore, \n",
      "at higher secondary stage, the curriculum of CS introduces basics of \n",
      "computing and sufficient conceptual background of Computer Science.\n",
      "The primary focus is on fostering the development of computational \n",
      "thinking and problem-solving skills. This book has 11 chapters covering \n",
      "the following broader themes:\n",
      "•\tFundamentals: basic understanding of computer system, hardware \n",
      "components and software, data representation, number system, \n",

      "programming language — program structure, identifiers, variables, \n",
